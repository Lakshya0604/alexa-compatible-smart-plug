Arduino board
It is an open hardware development board that can be used by tinkeres,hobbyists,and amkers to design and build devices that INTERACT WITH THE REAL WORLD.
In our project we use this to transfer our code to Arduino board to act like that we want 
letâ€™s talk about some importants part of our Arduino board
1. microcontroller
2. Arduino microcontroller are pre programmed with a bootloader that simplies the uploadingof programs to the on-chip flash memory.thedefault bootloader of the Arduino uno is the optiboot bootloader.boards are loader with program code via a serial connection to another computer.
