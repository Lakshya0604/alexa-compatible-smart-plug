Arduino board
It is an open hardware development board that can be used by tinkeres,hobbyists,and amkers to design and build devices that INTERACT WITH THE REAL WORLD.
In our project we use this to transfer our code to Arduino board to act like that we wantletâ€™s talk about some importants part of our Arduino board 1. microcontroller     Arduino microcontroller are pre programmed     with a bootloader that simplies the uploading     of programs to the on-chip flash memory.the             default bootloader of the Arduino uno is the     optiboot bootloader.boards are loader with      program code via a serial connection to      another computer![image](https://github.com/Lakshya0604/alexa-compatible-smart-plug/assets/152275636/f77773cd-a7d1-4ea8-abee-7944f82dc352)
