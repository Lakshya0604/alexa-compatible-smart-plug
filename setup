While connecting are board with are system we face some problem 
1.	 first We know are board, I use Arduino compatible based esp2866
2.	Know your ide to upload code I use Arduino ide to upload my code 
3.	In Arduino you have to  change some settings according to your board. First chose the board my board is not there so I go to tools<board<board manager<then in search box type esp8266 < and install it.
4.	Then go to file < preferences<in url paste this http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
5.	In tools change upload speed to 115200.i change board to lolin wemos d1 r1 and change port
6.	First go to device manager and go to port and which port it show then change the port in Arduino com port.
7.	Then upload code and check it.
8.	If you see this error a( fatal esptool.py error occurred: cannot configure port, something went wrong. original message: permissionerror) then install a drive from this link https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/all and download exe version .
9.	Then go to file < example<digital<blink then upload your program then your board start blinking it means your program is uploading then it stop after that it start blinking according to the program.
10.	So ,it work properly then your board is ready to do your project now you can uploud any program.
